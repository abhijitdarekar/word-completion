they think I am nuts
then we will find another way
where are you going
i do not know
what you named it already
tell me some more about this krueger guy
nobody thinks that
then get out
she must have fallen asleep at the table
i thought about that
yeah I am just aces
mark are you okay
that is why it is my fault dan's dead
I have got to write some of this down
well we gotta do something
greta come on one burger with me
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis
give up mark it is hopeless
you know my mother get real what about alice's
pimples heartburn cellulite and no modeling career
my undying love have some
next life oh what is that
yeah when are you gonna come to your senses
all of us right
i want to talk about the baby
stop saying that it is bullshit
have another one sounds like you need it
makes you look like a nun
these things are wild what do you think
he invited me to his house last night
stick around please
i cannot listen to this
two hours a day six days a week
i do not know
but if they 'u'do''u'
which is the one we have to worry about
I would sooner swim
then this is a 'flying saucer'
unidentified flying objects
you mean 'u'nothing''u is worth fighting for
you are really a mixed up oddball are not you
we are 'u'all''u risking our lives
'u'you''u said it but i will not argue
what did you mean I am 'out'
my father he is not
your 'out' this came for you
what is it
you could train someone else
and they thought 'u'you''u could re place the skipper
how is he
what is goin on in here lad what
oh it does''
here keep these it wants me to come alone
I am with 'u'you'''u
we will have to look for them later
wonder where powell and carney are
somewhere down there
the sound again
you hear that
you know it 'u'is''u'
hey you know somethin' it is getting lighter in here
strange you did not hear it omit 274f
listen hear that
i think you are right
not 'u'alone''u' you are not
you have got to let us try skipper
skipper look at the depth gauge
we are stuck tight
a lot of people think like that
i might have a son like 'u'that'''u
disappointing a 'u'big''u girl
'u'that's''u the worst possible moment
so they caught up with you too
helen i appeal to you
sidearms but the saucer's dead
you better take powell and carney with you
right at our one eyed friend
what course skipper
speed about twenty two knots course due north
course and speed
i do not know
what about down
seems to be all around
is there any way out of it
why do you say that
skipper could you take a look here
excuse me skipper
what about time
radiation level constantly rising
now they feel it down below
there is got to be an explanation
as we near the pole
what direction does the system indicate
the radiation level from the saucer it is rising
above murmansk and finland
what is the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole
nothing we can do now
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots
suppose there is an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops
and we are at safe maximum depth already stop engines
we can 'u'ram''u him
but what can we accomplish
that is what i said
right 'u'at''u him
thirty four seconds
what is the running time
take a look
you are sure it is cyclops
after torpedo room report
determine extent of damage immediately
i think i should have joined the air force
what do you think
it will be all right we are old friends
'doctor neilsen when did 'u'that''u happen
dr neilsen he will be
i met dr kent once
thought you were going to washington skipper
'u'that''u might be a 'u'little''u 'u'rough''u'
to navigate will not you have to see your way
on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect
why not me what am i the closing act
i am afraid not therefore
your friend was to remain where he was
for horrors like yourself
that is a 'u'face''u'''
remove your weapons commander and come here alone
all right go to it
toward the pole
due north at five knots no six
but 'u'answers''u are what we need not more questions
or perhaps until he gets us
our 'cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
I shall  be another
well I shall  be

you are doing just fine
frank do not you have something to say
hello liberty missoura
hell of a war

pff they hardly even noticed you
distracting enough for you
so we got a plan
everything but the boring parts
how much of that story is true
so what was he
cannot argue that
but he killed a lot of men too
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
they are making him a hero now

as a matter of fact i have
have you any place in mind
still a bit chilly
a fine night mrs peel
in a beautiful pea green boat
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea
the plot hello we must be going

I am a wanted woman i know
quite any childhood friends enemies
or grown ups who still like to be children
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all children's things
no idea who no idea why
i told mother i took care of you
as far as you trust me
you do not trust me
no after you
after you mrs peel
winning is not everything
I am playing to win
i thought you did not
i thought you played by the rules
are not we all mrs peel
you are playing games
not for a moment
but you did suspect me
is that all
keeping a stiff upper lip
mmm what are you doing
it was not me you have my word
and do you trust me
because you always obey orders
i could save you the trouble
to kill me
you followed me
it was peter i saw him
where am i
mrs peel
i expect we will have to gatecrash
someone did not want us to get to the party
here's the one that broke the camel's back
this must be the last straw
what lady disdain are you yet breathing
do you always drive this fast
oh well just my type mrs peel
is that what you think
not that i know of explanation
and by you mrs peel
three agents killed by bad weather
sounds as if someone's hijacked your research
that is what we were working on
but if someone miniaturized the process
filling in mother nature's blind spots
is there anything that is not
not quite this is my field
do not bother here's a bus
for you mrs peel
she had this in her mouth there there
common knowledge mrs peel
is that written in his shoe
what on earth
very good steed
how on earth can you tell
colonel crabtree international satellite systems formerly of the ministry
you mean my other self
i must say you look more your old self
did you say formal i must dress
an invitation to a 'formal picnic
did he say who
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
frankly that is how i remember it
why should they think that
i might say the same
i was not about to
you should be dead how do you feel
ah brenda mrs peel
small talk try the weather
so i distract him while you snoop around how
any other vices
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
june july august
an eccentric recluse
i meant me
for a man in my position
do we always follow mother's instructions
as per mother's instructions
sir august merryweather why are we seeing him first
and i suppose you are the knight
but why what is the point
do you really think so
that place is so absurd so out of date
thank you trubshaw
you can but i wish you would not
steed we really must be
or half cocked
i thought we were on our way
yes indeed i need protection
i had a feeling you would touche
really i fail to see the connection
my father always wanted a boy
ah from trubshaw's my shoemaker
we are not here to talk about the weather surely
showers followed by sunny periods
i did not mother did
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
and just what is the game
rules are made to be broken
whereas you are
so what was all this some sort of test
1922 why the kippers
i should not wonder not a woman inside boodles since
i had a spot of bother at the door
i was about to throw in the towel
and you must be steed please do not get up
doctor peel i presume
you do not believe him
you are saying i have no choice
I am no spy where do i fit in
you are not venturing alone surely
i shall need a small plane
very good mrs peel
let me guess wonderland weather
privately owned by
well i cannot possibly go like this
i fail to see
getting to what
i was getting to it
makes two of us
who is now vanished
surveillance by whom
i know all this
half brother to be precise
peter's brother but
you reek of mrs peel's black leather
how did you guess
dead I am afraid
we want mrs peel
so you say
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns
in your operation
i was hoping you could tell me
mother and father know best
guilty until proven innocent
pity i was growing fond of mrs peel unfortunately
you are accusing mrs peel of killing her own husband
this man did you see him
anyone particular in mind
she may try to kill you
possibly split personality
think she really killed those agents
you did not come to talk about the weather surely
weather's turning nasty
brenda and i thought we would drop in
mother i thought you were burglars
wonderland weather ltd
you with mother or father
i feel sure of it
cocky little bastard i hope he was a baddy
i think so thank you so much

well it is a game of anticipation that is the beauty
it is too slow
i asked for a policeman
how do you know that
ohhhh i do not think so
cannot do that now though can you
where is the cabin
would you have believed me
mueller was alone in the cabin
what about the phosphorous grenade
the creek bed

your weapons sergeant

what do not you know
i i do not know
his chest was hamburger
from up close or far away
full clip to the body
you saw west right how was he killed
that still does not mean you did not kill him
why why did not you tell me
pull up my sleeve right arm
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me
just look little pocket
look in my pack
you hated west mueller loved him
who you gonna trust ray him or your friend
that is exactly what he says about you
oh come on
if not you then who
you are the only one missing a grenade
maybe but that do not make me a killer
you hated west more than any of us
you know it is not like that
we just want to check your pack
roberto what the fuck
where have you been jay
what do you mean west's
west's any kindling for afire
whose blood is that jay
where are they
i do not know
because i was standing next to him
how do you know
because of what i saw who really killed west
i did not do anything
something funny levi
dunbar will testify that you were
no i said dunbar
is it the truth
my heart weeps
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar
somebody emptied a full clip into him
why did he come back for you
he admitted it
no poetic justice though
but you did not
then who did
i did not kill him
what happened to 'degrees'
senator daddy must be thrilled
but not the only victim right
I have done nothing wrong I am the victim here
get your hands away from the desk
not for long
I am not even going to dignify that
i wanted to see if he was okay
or what you have gone round the bend
stay where you are
what are you talking about
i thought you said that was not a compliment
you are a good soldier bill
I am sorry bill
they are taking your command are not they
you think you could explain all this to me
maybe but it is my fault and I shall  carry it
that is horseshit and you know it
does osborne agree
was dead right you think dunbar's on the level
what i said before
what the hell are you talking about
what about the confession
home I am done
tom where are you going
you mean not enough to save you
not for me
nevertheless what' kendall will testify and that'll be enough
we have already been over the terrain twice nothing
who killed pike
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez
he can wait kendall's out of surgery
I am not gonna let that happen
and I am the closest thing to it right
I am assuming that is what made him the dead one
and the problem is you only got three
well he is a good soldier
tell me what i can do
what kind of trouble are you in
how are you
he was your friend
your phone number
i should probably write that down
think it will work
leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
what are you doing out here
do i have a choice in this
nobody saw but i do not think so
you are a good man hardy
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
that is not true
what if i do not want it
this is not the time
we need to talk
no death certificates no crime
no bodies no west
where is west's body
hardy for chrissakes
is not this how your story goes
hardy what are you doing
right back where we started
good just making sure
we were close to something with kendall
that is gonna stay my secret
think it will work
so what now
so did i
you wanted to break him
you mean the falsely accused
you wanted to get the truth
yeah i could have should have
you could not have known
i pushed him too hard
that is a fantastic idea
positive hardy they planned this
are you sure
they got their stories straight
we are fucked i know
let us go talk to bill
that bugs you too
buttfucks the cabin
what happened next
at least you and kendall agree on that
i did not shoot west
why do you care
but you will
phenomenal at taking bribes right
goddammit hardy you cannot just leave
styles could not reassign him he is a legend
i do not know
why the fuck was not he in restraints
everyone's capable of murder osborne
i do not think that has anything to do with
'too neat' how long have you been an investigator
i lied wait for it
that was kid gloves
not the happiest of memories
being back here gives me the willies
he is telling the truth up to a point
you are off to a late start
i plan to grow on you
the very same
i lost a bet
something like that you
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
what is that
best time for banal chit chat
we are in the middle of a murder case
you are right we should sit in silence
you made me look like an idiot
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars
the colonel saw you shoot nunez you are a murderer
something like that
good cop'bad cop
that is the most unprofessional
is dunbar cute
he is in interrogation
senator jonathan kendall of ohio
levi who names their kid levi
you and the colonel go back
and you notice I am not in the army anymore
i did not mean that as a compliment
he was our drill here man's older than sand
you knew sergeant west
fantastic you want to tell me what is going on
hostile and uncooperative
i do not think i want to hear this
what are you talking about
so you took off your shirt
i was freezing from the hurricane
oh you remember now
i remember now it was before the explosion
yeah and he does not know when
pike and i got separated
poor fucker my ass
we should tell him we are not going
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
the faggot speaks
maybe we should not go
what happened with nunez
dunbar's telling the truth
enjoy your flight to washington
it will not work
you cannot threaten me
dunbar says you were
pike never confessed
we have been making progress i see
pike never confessed
but you did not see it right
because he would shot mueller
nunez was chasing dunbar
he whispered it in my ear
no one else heard it
'you're gonna die tonight faggot' clear as day
he said what
he wanted more than that
we just want
tell him to shut up
the fuck are you talking about
we are not going anywhere
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here
i used it to start the fire
where is your shirt mueller
